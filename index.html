        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>
          Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
          sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers:
          Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 â€“ 7 March
          2021),Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).He was
          extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
          throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to
          his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.
        </p>
        <h3>Writings</h3>
        <p>
          In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to
          develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by
          the year 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons
          programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.
